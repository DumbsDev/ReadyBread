# The Beginner Guide to Earning on ReadyBread

If you're new to ReadyBread, this guide will help you earn your first few dollars the easy way. ReadyBread was built to keep things simple, so most users are able to make their first cashout within just 10 minutes.

## 1. Start With Game Offers  
Game offers are often the highest paying and most reliable way to earn. Each game has clear objectives, like reaching a level or completing a tutorial, and payouts are shown upfront. Over the course of an hour, you would make less than surveys, but you'll have a *lot* more fun making money playing games then making money filling out surveys.

## 2. Try Short Surveys  
If you only have a few minutes, surveys are great fillers. Stick to surveys that match your interests for higher approval rates. They are by far the **highest** earners on the site, with some being $10 for just 5 minutes of your time. That being said, doing too many too fast can be draining, and also suspicious. We take pride in our security, so please be honest in your surveys or you will be banned.

## 3. Check Daily Bonuses  
We always have a daily bonus. Every consecutive day you log in, you actually earn more per offer. A lot of other sites like ReadyBread give you a flat five cents or so. We are different. Logging in every day earns you 0.5% more earnings, up to 10%. That adds up really fast, making a $10 offer go to $11. that's 20 days worth of login streaks on a competing platform in *just one offer*.

## 4. Cash Out When Ready  
Once your balance hits the minimum, which is just $3, pick PayPal, CashApp, crypto, or gift cards.

You can also choose to donate if you feel. We match all donations by 5%. If you have a charity you want to donate to, but it isn't listed, shoot us an email at contact@readybread.xyz, and we will look into it!

That’s it. Simple, fast, and designed for people who want to earn without the confusion of points, or weird mechanics. We try our best to be straight forward, and we hope you enjoy your stay! 💖
