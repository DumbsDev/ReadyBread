# Surveys vs. Games: Which Pays Better?

Both surveys and games can be strong earners, but each works differently depending on your time and interests.

## Surveys  
- Good for quick cash  
- Best for users who enjoy sharing opinions  
- Approval varies by profile
- Higher earnings per hour

## Games  
- Higher direct payouts
- More consistent  
- Multiple milestones per offer
- A whole lot more fun


## Which Should You Pick?  
Most users do both. Surveys fill short gaps of time, and games give bigger rewards when you have longer sessions available. The highest paying survey is up to about $10, while games can have up to $100 bonuses. However, the games do take more time than the surveys.
