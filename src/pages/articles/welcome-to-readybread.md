## 🧈 **Tips To Earn More Bread**

### ✔ Pick higher paying offers  
They take longer but often pay better for your time.

### ✔ Stick to one device, and one device
This keeps your account safe and avoids partner flags.

### ✔ Keep your streak alive  
A strong streak makes every offer worth more.

### ✔ Have fun
Surveys earn the most / minute, but let's be honest. They aren't as fun. Playing games earns a little bit less, but you are more likely to stick with a game for an hour then you are to do surveys for an hour.
