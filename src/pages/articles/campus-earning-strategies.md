# Campus-Friendly Earning Strategies for Students

ReadyBread fits naturally into a college schedule. Here are a few realistic ways to earn between classes without losing focus.

## 1. Morning Coffee Grind  
Take 10 minutes before class to knock out a short survey or start a game tutorial. Even just two or three surveys in the morning before your first class can pay for your coffee on the way to class!

## 2. Commute Gaming  
If you bus or train to campus, level-based games are perfect for this downtime. Make that 30 minute metro ride into your side gig, and start earning!

## 3. Weekend Push  
Some game offers give multiple payout events. A few hours on a Saturday can complete all of them.

## 4. Group Earnings  
Introduce friends and classmates. Everyone earns, and the referral bonuses stack quickly. We also run referral bonuses, so make sure you keep an eye out for those as you have the chance to earn *even more*.

The goal is simple: earn without disrupting your daily routine.
