# How Cost-Per-Event (CPE) Works on ReadyBread

CPE is one of the most popular ways to earn on ReadyBread. It simply means you earn money for completing specific events inside a game. It actually is an acronym, meaning "Cost Per Event". It is really how all offerwalls and GPT (Get Paid To) platforms work.
