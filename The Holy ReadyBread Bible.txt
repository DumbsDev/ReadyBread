This is the ReadyBread documentation, or "The Holy ReadyBread Bible".


It is a user-first GPT platform, allowing users to play games or fill out surveys to earn cash. We are user-first, as we do not use the typical "points" system, instead you get what you see, in US cash. We also plan to provide multiple ways for the user to withdraw their funds, at a minimum of $3. We also plan to have 0 fees for cashing out, and all costs will be taken ahead of time, streamlining the withdrawal process.
